a software engineer focusing primarly on iOS & AI. Through my 3 years of professional career I have worked on a diverse set of projects spanning fintech, CSM, document scanning & verification, repair service etc.

Lately, beside iOS I've been focusing on AI - building AI solutions that run on the Apple platforms. 

I've started this blog with a goal of contributing more to open source projects, documenting the process, sharing knowledge and expirience.
