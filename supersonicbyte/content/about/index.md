a seasoned engineer with a passion of building disruptive software that runs on iOS. I have worked and contributed on a diverse set of projects including fintech, CSM, document scanning & verification, IoT, repair service etc.

Lately, I've been focusing on briding the AI revolution to iOS.

I've started this blog with a goal of contributing more to open source projects, building in public & documenting the process, sharing knowledge and expirience.
